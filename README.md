# paranoid-reborn
A continuation of the now deleted ParanoidLinux project, which sought to recreate the fictional OS from the book Little Brother.
A work in progress, I've only just started this.
# Planned features
I intend to make this OS Debian-based, with the default desktop environment being GNOME. Here's some features I'm looking into:
Chaff communications, possibly with profiles that show different types of people (i.e. a student profile where the chaff is school stuff)
An option for a dead man's switch, which could shut down and/or wipe a computer if it doesn't recieve a password for a set amount of time
A panic button that switches to a VM that shows nothing suspicious (would match the chaff profile)
Something in GRUB where it asks for a password, and it boots into a different system depending on the password given
Here are some of the packages that will come with it (that I've thought of so far, feel free to add suggestions):
Firefox
GIMP
Thunderbird Mail
Transmission
GUFW
Tor Browser
Veracrypt
Libreoffice
# Note
I'm no professional. This is mostly proof of concept. So if you actually need a secure OS, I'd reccomend TAILS.
